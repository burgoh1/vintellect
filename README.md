vintellect landing page

Documentation:
12/19 - I decided to document my work here. I learned about key frames and animation. I added a marquee track for my hero section. I'm planning on adding another marquee track on top of my existing marquee track to act as a sort of custom border in between each picture. Right now I have the vintellect logo on top of my hero but I want to replace it with the classic header+paragraph+CTAbutton. I also want to add another marquee track under my hero with brand logos to act as testimonials. Now that I think about it, it might be too much having two marquee tracks side by side for the user to see. I will think about that more l8r.

12/19 (after hours :P) - I uploaded my project to github actions and viewed the website on my actual phone (Iphone 12 pro max) and there are some things I wanna change. The first thing I wanna change is the header. It's either the header is too large or the logo is too big. The padding for the hamburger bar is a little too much too. maybe reduce the padding by 10px? The body background can also be changed so it's the same color as the header. There's little tweeks I can change if I really wanna be picky but I think it's more important to implement most of the bare bone structure of the website before being picky with the details. I didn't have time to really add or change anything to the website today but I hope I can add some more changes maybe tonight or tomorrow morning.
